The user-centred information retrieval needs to introduce semantics into the user modelling for 
a meaningful representation of user interests. The semantic representation of the user interests 
helps to improve the identification of the user’s future cognitive needs. In this paper, we present 
a semantic-based approach for a personalised information retrieval. This approach is based on the 
design and the exploitation of a user profile to represent the user and his interests. In this user
 profile, we combine an ontological semantics issued from WordNet ontology, and a personal semantics 
 issued from the different user interactions with the search system and with his social and situational 
 of his previous searches. The personal semantics considers the co-occurrence relations between relevant
 components of the user profile as semantic links. The user profile is used to improve two important 
 phases of the information search process: (i) expansion of the initial user query and (ii) adaptation 
 of the search results to the user interests.
