Swarm intelligence algorithms are now among the most widely used soft computing techniques for optimization 
and computational intelligence. One recent swarm intelligence algorithm that has begun to receive more attention 
is Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO). It is an enhanced version of PSO with global optimization capability, 
sufficient simplicity and high flexibility. In this paper, we propose the application of the APSO technique to efficiently 
solve the problem of Query Expansion (QE) in Web Information Retrieval (IR). Unlike prior studies, we introduce 
a new modelling of QE that aims to find the suitable expanded query from among a set of expanded query candidates. 
Nevertheless, due to the large number of potential expanded query candidates, it is extremely complex to produce the best 
one through conventional hard computing methods. Therefore, we propose to consider the problem of QE as a combinatorial 
optimization problem and address it with APSO. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed APSO for QE using MEDLINE, the world
Web’s largest medical library. We first conduct a preliminary experiment to tune the APSO parameters. Then, we compare 
the results to a recent swarm intelligence algorithm called Firefly Algorithm (FA). We also compare the results with 
three recently published methods for QE that involved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Bat 
Algorithm (BA). The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed APSO for QE is very competitive and yields 
substantial improvement over the other methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and computational complexity.
