Motivated by the vast applications of knowledge graph and the increasing 
demand in education domain, we propose a system, called KnowEdu, to automatically 
construct knowledge graph for education. By leveraging on heterogeneous data 
(e.g., pedagogical data and learning assessment data) from the education domain, 
this system first extracts the concepts of subjects or courses and then identifies 
the educational relations between the concepts. More specifically, 
it adopts the neural sequence labeling algorithm on pedagogical data to extract instructional 
concepts and employs probabilistic association rule mining on learning assessment data to 
identify the relations with educational significance. We detail all the above mentioned efforts 
through an exemplary case of constructing a demonstrative knowledge graph for mathematics, 
where the instructional concepts and their prerequisite relations are derived from curriculum 
standards and concept-based performance data of students. Evaluation results show that the 
F1 score for concept extraction exceeds 0.70, and for relation identification, 
the area under the curve and mean average precision achieve 0.95 and 0.87, respectively.
